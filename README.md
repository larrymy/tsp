Next:

- minimise cost, with time, capacity, workload contraints and error considerations/allocations.


1) Better algorithm to solve TSP - faster, more accurate
(1 to many with 1 - 1 pickup point to many delivery point with 1 delivery man)

2) Vehicle Routing Problem (increase the complexity, allow multiple vehicles to deliver to multiple locations with 1 pickup point)
(1 to many with many - 1 pickup point to many delivery point with many delivery man)

3) VRP with capacity
(1 to many with many + capacity constraints)

4) VRP with time constraints

5) VRP with error consideration (+/- 10 mins)



A) Live reassignment - assign when new orders come in (can be to new delivery man, or in between tasks of a deivery man)
B) Unmet expectations reassignment - when delivery man could not meet expected delivery time (accident, unexpected downtime)
